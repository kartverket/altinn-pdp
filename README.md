## 🎯 About the project

A valid Maskinporten token proves that a systembruker belongs to the calling system. It does not
prove that the systembruker was ever granted access to any particular resource. There is
deliberately no link between the Maskinporten scope and the Altinn resource, so an API that only
validates the token has answered half the question.

The other half is a **PDP-oppslag**: asking Altinn's Policy Decision Point whether this
systembruker may act on behalf of this organisation, on this resource, in this way. That is what
this project is for.

> [!NOTE]
> A Kartverket API therefore makes two independent checks: it validates the token's scope itself,
> **and** it performs a PDP-oppslag. Neither one replaces the other.

| [`altinn-pdp-client`](altinn-pdp-client)           | Kotlin library that talks to Maskinporten and the Altinn PDP directly | a package, for other services to depend on                                    |
| [`altinn-pdp-rest-server`](altinn-pdp-rest-server) | Ktor server exposing a simplified REST/JSON API over the client       | a Docker image, built with [Jib](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib) |

`altinn-pdp-rest-server` is the intended consumer of `altinn-pdp-client`, so other systems can ask
"is this allowed?" over plain JSON without speaking Maskinporten and XACML themselves.

---

## 📦 Prerequisites

- JDK 21, or let the Gradle toolchain resolver provision one
- A [Maskinporten client](https://docs.digdir.no/docs/Maskinporten/maskinporten_guide_apikonsument.html):
  a client id and its private key as JWK, granted `altinn:authorization/authorize`
- An Azure API Management subscription key for the Access Management products, ordered from
  Altinn servicedesk. Without it the gateway rejects the call with 401 before the PDP sees it

---

## 🚀 Getting started

```bash
./gradlew build
```

Builds and tests every module. This is also what CI runs.

### Building the client

```kotlin
val client = PdpClient(
    environment = AltinnEnvironment.TT02,
    subscriptionKey = "<subscription key>",
    maskinportenClientId = "<client id>",
    maskinportenKey = MaskinportenKey.parse(jwkJson),
    httpClient = JavaPdpHttpClient(HttpClient.newHttpClient(), requestTimeout = Duration.ofSeconds(3)),
)
```

Build one client and reuse it. Both the Maskinporten token and the Altinn token are cached and
fetched again shortly before they expire, and it is safe to call from several coroutines at once.

### Asking the PDP

```kotlin
val authorization = client.authorize(
    systemuserId = SystemUserId.parse("<systembruker uuid>"),
    resourceId = ResourceId.parse("<resource id>"),
    customerOrganizationNumber = OrganizationNumber.parse("923609016"),
    action = ActionId.parse("read"),
)
```

The answer is a `PdpAuthorization`:

| Member                          | What it is                                                                                                                                                 |
| :------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `decision`                      | `PdpDecision`: `PERMIT`, `DENY`, `NOT_APPLICABLE` (no matching policy, not in itself an error) or `INDETERMINATE` (the PDP could not evaluate the request) |
| `isPermit`                      | Shorthand for `decision == PERMIT`                                                                                                                         |
| `obligations`                   | Every obligation Altinn attached, unfiltered, including ones this library does not model                                                                   |
| `minimumAuthenticationLevel`    | The `urn:altinn:minimum-authenticationlevel` obligation as an `Int`, or null                                                                               |
| `minimumAuthenticationLevelOrg` | The same for `urn:altinn:minimum-authenticationlevel-org`                                                                                                  |
| `statusCode`                    | Altinn's XACML status URN, or null                                                                                                                         |

> [!WARNING]
> A `PERMIT` that carries a `minimumAuthenticationLevel` is **conditional**. See
> [Authentication level obligations](#authentication-level-obligations).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is the org number of the customer the systembruker acts **on behalf of**, not your own.
> In the Maskinporten token it is `authorization_details[].systemuser_org`. It is **not** the
> `consumer` claim, which holds the vendor's org number. Strip the ISO6523 prefix: send
> `311718371`, not `0192:311718371`.

### HTTP client

`httpClient` takes a `PdpHttpClient`, and timeouts, proxy and so on are set on it. Implement it
on the HTTP client you already use, or use `JavaPdpHttpClient`:

```kotlin
JavaPdpHttpClient(
    HttpClient.newBuilder().connectTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(2)).build(),
    requestTimeout = Duration.ofSeconds(3),
)
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A `PdpHttpClient` must not follow redirects, since the calls carry tokens, and must throw an
> `IOException` when a call fails. OkHttp and Ktor client follow redirects by default, so turn
> that off if you build on one of them.

The server connects within 2 s and waits at most 3 s per call. A lookup makes at most three
calls, so callers of `POST /authorize` should allow 10 s.

### Running the server

Create the ignored local secrets file from the committed template, then start Ktor:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
./scripts/dev.sh
```

The server runs on <http://localhost:8080>, or on the port in `PORT`. `dev.sh` is what turns
`.env` into real environment variables - the server itself only ever reads the environment, so
starting it any other way (an IDE run configuration, `./gradlew :altinn-pdp-rest-server:run`)
means setting them yourself.

---

## 🔌 API

### `POST /authorize`

Request body:

```json
{
  "systemuserId": "<systembruker id from the token's authorization_details>",
  "resourceId": "<resource identifier in the Altinn Resource Registry>",
  "customerOrganizationNumber": "923609016",
  "action": "read"
}
```

All four fields are required strings, and are validated before Altinn is called:

| Felt                         | Regel                                                |
| :--------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| `systemuserId`               | UUID                                                 |
| `resourceId`                 | `^[a-z0-9_-]{4,}$`, the Resource Registry's own rule |
| `customerOrganizationNumber` | 9 digits with a valid MOD11 check digit              |
| `action`                     | Non-empty, no format constraint                      |

The Altinn subscription key and Maskinporten credentials are configured
server-side (see [Environment variables](#-environment-variables)) - callers never supply them.

Allow at least 10 seconds for a response, so a stalled Altinn reaches you as a `502` rather than
as a timeout of your own - see [HTTP client](#http-client).

Response body (`200 OK`):

```json
{
  "permit": true,
  "decision": "PERMIT",
  "status": "urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:status:ok",
  "minimumAuthenticationLevel": 3,
  "minimumAuthenticationLevelOrg": 3
}
```

`permit` is a boolean shorthand for `decision == "PERMIT"`.

`status`, `minimumAuthenticationLevel` and `minimumAuthenticationLevelOrg` are omitted when
Altinn sends nothing for them, so a response may still be just `permit` and `decision`.

`decision` is one of:

| Value            | Meaning                                                                      |
| :--------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PERMIT`         | The systembruker is allowed to perform `action` on the resource for that org |
| `DENY`           | Explicitly denied                                                            |
| `NOT_APPLICABLE` | No matching policy - not necessarily an error                                |
| `INDETERMINATE`  | The PDP couldn't evaluate the request                                        |

#### Authentication level obligations

A `PERMIT` can be **conditional**. When Altinn attaches a minimum authentication level to the
decision, it arrives as `minimumAuthenticationLevel` (and `minimumAuthenticationLevelOrg` for the
organisation-level equivalent).

This service cannot check those levels. It never sees your token - that is the point of the
design - so it passes them to you instead. **A `PERMIT` carrying a level you have not met is not
a permit.** Before acting on one, confirm your own end user authenticated at that level or higher.
Callers that ignore these fields are trusting a condition nobody verified.

#### Telling "no" apart from "couldn't tell"

`status` is Altinn's XACML status URN. `...:status:ok` means the question was evaluated;
`...:status:processing-error` means it wasn't. This matters because both come back as
`permit: false`: a misspelled `resourceId` returns `INDETERMINATE` with a processing-error status,
which is a bug in the caller, not a denial. Branch on `status` if you need to tell them apart.

Error responses (any non-2xx) share one shape:

```json
{
  "error": "<human-readable summary>",
  "code": "<stable machine-readable code>"
}
```

Branch on `code`, never on `error`. `error` is prose and may be reworded; `code` is part of the
contract. A validation failure adds an `errors` array listing **every** field that failed, not
just the first:

```json
{
  "error": "Validation failed",
  "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
  "errors": [
    {
      "field": "customerOrganizationNumber",
      "code": "INVALID_FORMAT",
      "message": "customerOrganizationNumber must have a valid MOD11 check digit"
    },
    { "field": "action", "code": "MISSING", "message": "action is required" }
  ]
}
```

| `code`              | Status | Meaning                                                                          |
| :------------------ | :----- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `VALIDATION_ERROR`  | 400    | One or more fields failed validation. See `errors`                               |
| `MALFORMED_BODY`    | 400    | Not valid JSON, or a field of the wrong type                                     |
| `UPSTREAM_REJECTED` | 400    | Altinn itself answered 400 to the request we built                               |
| `UPSTREAM_ERROR`    | 502    | Calling Maskinporten or Altinn failed, including our own auth and quota problems |
| `INTERNAL_ERROR`    | 500    | Anything unanticipated                                                           |

Per-field `code` is `MISSING` (absent, null or blank) or `INVALID_FORMAT` (present but wrong shape).

### `GET /health/live`

Liveness probe. Returns `200 OK` with an empty body if the server is up - not part of the stable
API.

## 🔑 Environment variables

| Variable                  | Required | Default |
| :------------------------ | :------- | :------ |
| `MASKINPORTEN_CLIENT_ID`  | yes      | -       |
| `MASKINPORTEN_CLIENT_JWK` | yes      | -       |
| `ALTINN_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY` | yes      | -       |
| `ALTINN_ENVIRONMENT`      | no       | `TT02`  |
| `ACCESS_LOG_ENABLED`      | no       | `true`  |
| `PORT`                    | no       | `8080`  |

See `.env.example` for what each variable is and where to get it.

`altinn-pdp-rest-server/src/main/resources/application.yaml` maps each one onto a configuration
key via Ktor's `$ENV_VAR` substitution, so a missing required variable stops the server at
startup rather than at the first request. A JVM system property of the same name works too, which
is occasionally handier than an environment variable in an IDE.

Never commit `.env`, and never print secrets in logs.

---

## 🌍 Environments

`environment` decides which Altinn and Maskinporten the client talks to:

| Environment | Altinn platform                   | Maskinporten                         |
| :---------- | :-------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| `TT02`      | `https://platform.tt02.altinn.no` | `https://test.maskinporten.no/token` |
| `PROD`      | `https://platform.altinn.no`      | `https://maskinporten.no/token`      |

---

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
./gradlew test
```

`./gradlew build` runs the tests as part of the build, and CI runs it on every pull request.
