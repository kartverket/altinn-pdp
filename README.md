## 🎯 About the project

A valid Maskinporten token proves that a systembruker belongs to the calling system. It does not
prove that the systembruker was ever granted access to any particular resource. There is
deliberately no link between the Maskinporten scope and the Altinn resource, so an API that only
validates the token has answered half the question.

The other half is a **PDP-oppslag**: asking Altinn's Policy Decision Point whether this
systembruker may act on behalf of this organisation, on this resource, in this way. That is what
this project is for.

> [!NOTE]
> A Kartverket API therefore makes two independent checks: it validates the token's scope itself,
> **and** it performs a PDP-oppslag. Neither one replaces the other.

## 🧩 Modules

| Module | What it is | Published as |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [`altinn-pdp-client`](altinn-pdp-client) | Kotlin library that talks to Maskinporten and the Altinn PDP directly | a package, for other services to depend on |
| [`altinn-pdp-rest-server`](altinn-pdp-rest-server) | Ktor server exposing a simplified REST/JSON API over the client | a Docker image, built with [Jib](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib) |

`altinn-pdp-rest-server` is the intended consumer of `altinn-pdp-client`, so other systems can ask
"is this allowed?" over plain JSON without speaking Maskinporten and XACML themselves.

---

## 📦 Prerequisites

- JDK 21, or let the Gradle toolchain resolver provision one
- A [Maskinporten client](https://docs.digdir.no/docs/Maskinporten/maskinporten_guide_apikonsument.html):
  a client id and its private key as JWK, granted `altinn:authorization/authorize`
- An Azure API Management subscription key for the Access Management products, ordered from
  Altinn servicedesk. Without it the gateway rejects the call with 401 before the PDP sees it

---

## 🚀 Getting started

```bash
./gradlew build
```

Builds and tests every module. This is also what CI runs.

### Building the client

```kotlin
val client = PdpClient.builder()
    .environment(AltinnEnvironment.TT02)
    .subscriptionKey("<subscription key>")
    .maskinportenClientId("<client id>")
    .maskinportenJwk(jwkJson)
    .build()
```

Build one client and reuse it. Both the Maskinporten token and the Altinn token are cached and
fetched again shortly before they expire, and it is safe to call from several coroutines at once.

`tokenProvider(...)` replaces the three Maskinporten setters with an `AltinnTokenProvider` you
built yourself, which is handy in tests or to share one provider across several clients.

### Asking the PDP

```kotlin
val decision = client.authorize(
    systemuserId = "<systembruker uuid>",
    resourceId = "<resource id>",
    organizationNumber = "923609016",
    action = "read",
)
```

The answer is a `PdpDecision`: `PERMIT`, `DENY`, `NOT_APPLICABLE` (no matching policy, which is
not in itself an error) or `INDETERMINATE` (the PDP could not evaluate the request). Use
`isPermitted(...)` instead when a boolean is all you need.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `organizationNumber` is the **customer's** plain Norwegian org number, the party whose access
> is being checked. It is not the vendor's, and not the ISO6523-prefixed form Maskinporten tokens
> use.

### Running the server

Create the ignored local secrets file from the committed template, then start Ktor:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
./scripts/dev.sh
```

The server runs on <http://localhost:8080>.

---

## 🔌 API

### `POST /authorize`

Request body:

```json
{
  "systemuserId": "<systembruker id from the token's authorization_details>",
  "resourceId": "<resource identifier in the Altinn Resource Registry>",
  "organizationNumber": "923609016",
  "action": "read"
}
```

All four fields are required strings. `organizationNumber` is the plain Norwegian org number
(no ISO6523 prefix). The Altinn subscription key and Maskinporten credentials are configured
server-side (see [Environment variables](#-environment-variables)) - callers never supply them.

Response body (`200 OK`):

```json
{
  "permit": true,
  "decision": "PERMIT"
}
```

`permit` is a boolean shorthand for `decision == "PERMIT"`.

`decision` is one of:

| Value | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| `PERMIT` | The systembruker is allowed to perform `action` on the resource for that org |
| `DENY` | Explicitly denied |
| `NOT_APPLICABLE` | No matching policy - not necessarily an error |
| `INDETERMINATE` | The PDP couldn't evaluate the request |

Error responses (any non-2xx) share one shape:

```json
{
  "error": "<human-readable message>"
}
```

| Status | Cause |
| :--- | :--- |
| `400 Bad Request` | Malformed/missing JSON fields, or Altinn rejected the request itself (e.g. unknown `resourceId`) |
| `502 Bad Gateway` | Calling Maskinporten or Altinn failed for a reason unrelated to this request's content |
| `500 Internal Server Error` | Anything unanticipated |

### `GET /health/live`

Liveness probe. Returns `200 OK` with an empty body if the server is up - not part of the stable
API.

## 🔑 Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `MASKINPORTEN_CLIENT_ID` | yes | - |
| `MASKINPORTEN_CLIENT_JWK` | yes | - |
| `ALTINN_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY` | yes | - |
| `ALTINN_ENVIRONMENT` | no | `TT02` |
| `MASKINPORTEN_TOKEN_URL` | no | TT02's Maskinporten token endpoint |

See `.env.example` for what each variable is and where to get it.

Never commit `.env`, and never print secrets in logs.

---

## 🌍 Environments

`AltinnEnvironment` fixes, from one choice, every value that has to stay consistent across an
environment: the Altinn platform base URL and the Maskinporten token endpoint.

| Environment | Altinn platform | Maskinporten |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `TT02` | `https://platform.tt02.altinn.no` | `https://test.maskinporten.no/token` |
| `PROD` | `https://platform.altinn.no` | `https://maskinporten.no/token` |

The client also has raw base-URL constructors for pointing at a local test server.

---

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
./gradlew test
```

`./gradlew build` runs the tests as part of the build, and CI runs it on every pull request.
